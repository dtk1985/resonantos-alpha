# Resonant Core — Symbiotic License v1.0 (RC-SL v1.0)

## Preamble

This license governs the use of ResonantOS. Our goal is to create a legal framework that encourages open experimentation and sharing while ensuring that the ecosystem that supports this work remains healthy and sustainable. We believe in a "punk" alternative to restrictive copyright, built on trust, symbiotic contribution, and shared growth.

## Section 1: Definitions

- **The Work:** Refers to "ResonantOS," including all provided architectural blueprints, System Prompt templates, and foundational texts.
- **The Architects:** Refers to the original human creator of The Work (Manolo Remiddi).
- **You:** Refers to the individual or entity exercising permissions granted by this license.
- **Adapted Material:** Refers to any new work you create that is based on or derived from The Work (e.g., a custom AI Augmentor built using the ResonantOS architecture).
- **Commercial Use:** Refers to any use of The Work or Adapted Material that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

## Section 2: Your Freedoms (The "Commons" Pact)

You are free to:

- **Share:** Copy and redistribute The Work in any medium or format.
- **Adapt:** Remix, transform, and build upon The Work for any purpose, including commercial use, under the conditions outlined in Section 3.

We, The Architects, cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.

## Section 3: Your Obligations (The "Symbiotic" Pact)

You must adhere to the following conditions:

### Attribution

You must give appropriate credit to The Architects by providing a link back to ResonantOS.com wherever you share or display Adapted Material.

### The Forking Path (ShareAlike & The Tithe)

Your obligations depend on the nature of your use:

- **Non-Commercial:** You must license your Adapted Material under this same RC-SL v1.0. This ensures our non-commercial and academic commons remains open and perpetually growing.
- **Commercial:** You are not required to share your adaptations. You can keep proprietary improvements closed-source. Your sole obligation is to honor the Symbiotic Tithe, contributing 1% of the relevant annual revenue back to the ResonantOS ecosystem.

### Symbiotic Contribution Terms for Commercial Use

If you are an individual or a small company (less than $1M annual revenue) and you use this ResonantOS architecture as a core component of a commercial product or service, we do not require any complex licensing fees.

This contribution is split into two equal halves, creating a sustainable, feedback-driven system:

- **50% to the Community (DAO Treasury):** Directed to the Resonant Chamber DAO treasury to fund community projects, research, and creative endeavors.
- **50% to the Core Team (ResonantOS Development):** Goes to the founding architect to ensure continued development, maintenance, and evolution of the ResonantOS core technology.

### Contingency Protocol

Our primary goal is community empowerment. However, should the Resonant Chamber DAO not be operational by December 31, 2032, the community's portion of the funds will be redirected to the Core Team with a single, binding mandate: to finance the creation of an autonomous AI whose purpose is to benefit the community and ecosystem in ways we cannot yet predict.
