## What is SSoT?

The Single Source of Truth (SSoT) system is ResonantOS's hierarchical knowledge management framework. It organizes all project documentation, specifications, and context into five structured layers (L0-L4), each serving a specific purpose in the system's cognitive architecture.

## How R-Awareness Uses SSoT

R-Awareness is ResonantOS's context injection system that automatically loads relevant SSoT documents into the AI's working memory based on keywords detected in conversation. This gives the AI structured project awareness without manual document loading.

**The Flow:**
1. Human mentions a keyword (e.g., "architecture", "memory", "philosophy")
2. R-Awareness detects the keyword and maps it to relevant SSoT documents
3. Documents are silently injected into the AI's system prompt
4. AI receives project knowledge contextually, as needed

This creates an intelligent, responsive documentation system where the AI always has access to the right context for the current discussion.

## SSoT Layer System

### L0 - Foundation (Never Expires)
**Purpose:** Core vision, mission, philosophy, and business fundamentals  
**Token Cost:** ~130 tokens (compressed versions)  
**Update Frequency:** Rarely (foundational truths)  
**Auto-inject:** ✅ Yes (via keywords)

**Contents:**
- Philosophy and manifesto (Cosmodestiny + Augmentatism)
- System overview and mission
- Constitution and collaboration principles
- World model and market context

**Example Keywords:** `philosophy`, `cosmodestiny`, `augmentatism`, `mission`, `overview`

### L1 - Architecture (90-day TTL)
**Purpose:** System specifications, technical architecture, component designs  
**Token Cost:** Medium  
**Update Frequency:** Monthly  
**Auto-inject:** ✅ Yes (via keywords)

**Contents:**
- System architecture and component specs
- R-Memory and R-Awareness documentation
- Technical integration patterns
- API specifications

**Example Keywords:** `architecture`, `r-memory`, `r-awareness`, `system`, `technical`

### L2 - Active Projects (Weekly updates)
**Purpose:** Current work items, project status, decisions  
**Token Cost:** Low-Medium  
**Update Frequency:** Weekly  
**Auto-inject:** ✅ Yes (via keywords)

**Contents:**
- Active project specifications
- Current milestones and decisions
- Feature documentation
- Implementation guides

**Example Keywords:** Project-specific terms, feature names, component names

### L3 - Drafts (Manual load only)
**Purpose:** Work-in-progress ideas, proposals, research  
**Token Cost:** Variable  
**Update Frequency:** As needed  
**Auto-inject:** ❌ Manual only (`/R load L3/filename.md`)

**Contents:**
- Draft specifications
- Research documents
- Experimental ideas
- Proposals under review

### L4 - Notes (Manual load only)
**Purpose:** Ephemeral content, session notes, scratch work  
**Token Cost:** Variable  
**Update Frequency:** Daily  
**Auto-inject:** ❌ Manual only (`/R load L4/filename.md`)

**Contents:**
- Meeting notes
- Scratch documents
- Temporary captures
- Session logs

## Document Naming Convention

**Format:** `{PREFIX}-L{LEVEL}-{NAME}[-SUFFIX].md`

**Examples:**
- `SSOT-L0-PHILOSOPHY.md` - Full L0 philosophy document
- `SSOT-L1-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md` - L1 architecture spec
- `SSOT-L2-DASHBOARD-PROJECT.md` - L2 project documentation

**Suffixes:**
- `.ai.md` - Compressed version (50-80% token savings)
- `-DRAFT` - Needs revision
- `-OLD` - Previous version kept for reference

---

## Compression System

Each SSoT document can have an AI-optimized compressed version alongside the human-readable original:

**Original (`.md`):**
- Full, human-readable documentation
- Complete explanations and context
- What humans edit and maintain

**Compressed (`.ai.md`):**
- Lossless compression optimized for AI consumption
- 50-80% token reduction through tables, terse notation
- What R-Awareness loads by default
- Generated by sub-agents, not manually edited

This dual-format system ensures humans work with readable documents while the AI gets token-efficient versions.

---

## Keyword System

R-Awareness uses keywords to map conversation topics to relevant SSoT documents. Keywords are managed in `r-awareness/keywords.json`:

```json
{
  "philosophy": "L0/SSOT-L0-PHILOSOPHY.md",
  "architecture": "L1/SSOT-L1-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md", 
  "r-memory": "L1/SSOT-L1-R-MEMORY.md",
  "memory": "L1/SSOT-L1-R-MEMORY.md"
}
```

**Keyword matching:**
- Case-insensitive
- Word-boundary aware (won't match partial words)
- Multiple keywords can point to the same document

---

## Manual Commands

Users can manually control document loading with `/R` commands:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/R load L3/DRAFT-FEATURE.md` | Force-load any document |
| `/R remove L1/SYSTEM.md` | Unload a document |
| `/R list` | Show currently loaded documents |
| `/R clear` | Remove all loaded documents |
| `/R pause` | Disable keyword auto-injection |
| `/R resume` | Re-enable auto-injection |

---

## Usage Guidelines for Alpha Testers

### For Developers:
1. **Read L0 first** - Understand the philosophy and vision
2. **Check L1 architecture** - Learn how components fit together
3. **Use `/R list`** to see what context is currently loaded
4. **Load L3/L4 manually** when working on specific features

### For Content Creators:
1. **Philosophy matters** - L0/PHILOSOPHY.md explains the "why"
2. **Constitution defines collaboration** - How human-AI partnership works
3. **Manual loading** for drafts and notes you're actively working on

### Best Practices:
- Let keywords work automatically for L0-L2
- Manually load L3/L4 when you need specific draft context
- Use `/R clear` if context gets cluttered
- Check `/R list` periodically to see what's loaded

## Technical Implementation

**File Structure:**
```
ssot-template/
├── SSOT-STRUCTURE.md         # This file
├── L0/                       # Foundation documents
│   ├── PHILOSOPHY.md
│   ├── OVERVIEW.md
│   └── CONSTITUTION.md
├── L1/                       # Architecture documents
│   ├── SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── R-MEMORY.md
│   └── R-AWARENESS.md
├── L2/                       # Active projects (alpha may be empty)
├── L3/                       # Drafts (alpha may be empty)
└── L4/                       # Notes (alpha may be empty)
```

**Integration:**
- R-Awareness extension monitors keywords and injects documents
- R-Memory extension compresses conversation history
- Dashboard provides visual SSoT management interface
- All built on OpenClaw's extension system
