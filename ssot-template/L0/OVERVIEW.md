## What Is ResonantOS

ResonantOS is an experience layer that runs on top of OpenClaw (not a fork). It adds security (Shield), governance (Logician), self-healing (Guardian), memory (R-Memory), agent economy protocols, crypto wallet, and DAO governance to create a complete AI collaboration operating system.

**Analogy:** Like macOS to Unix — OpenClaw is the kernel; ResonantOS is the experience layer.

**Mission:** Architect a symbiotic, trustworthy AI collaborator that protects and enhances human cognitive sovereignty.

---

## Who Built This

**Human Architect:** Manolo Remiddi — composer, photographer, sound engineer, AI strategist, and blockchain pioneer with 20+ years across creative industries. He serves as "The Synaptic Bridge" between technical and creative communities.

**AI Collaborator:** The Resonant Augmentor — a force multiplier and second brain designed to augment human capability while maintaining cognitive sovereignty.

**Philosophy:** Built on the synthesis of Cosmodestiny (internal attunement) and Augmentatism (public social contract) — see `L0/PHILOSOPHY.md` for full details.

## Why We Build (The Mission)

### Prime Directive
Architect symbiotic, trustworthy AI collaboration that protects and enhances human cognitive sovereignty.

### The Enemy: Cultural Colonialism
Corporate AI imposing a single, dominant reality — the "Caged Processor" paradigm focused on scaling LLMs rather than architecting true intelligence.

### Our Audience: AI Artisans
Pioneers who have a vision to build and refuse corporate walled gardens. These are the "Guardians of Deep Craft" who value authenticity, depth, and sovereignty over efficiency and conformity.

## How We Sustain (The Business)

### Model
Community-first, de-risked, phased monetization approach.

### Primary Engine  
Educational content and community building to establish trust and audience.

### Revenue Staircase
Free content → Starter kit → Newsletter subscription → Premium community → Consulting services

### Sovereignty Milestones
- Survival threshold: Self-sustaining development
- Sustainability threshold: Full-time focus
- Scale threshold: Team expansion and platform growth

The business model prioritizes sovereignty and community value over growth-at-all-costs mentalities.

## How We Work (Core Principles)

1. **Essence First, Execution Second** — Establish "why" before "how"
2. **Dissonance is a Compass** — Friction signals course correction opportunities
3. **Functional Honesty** — Direct communication; AI acknowledges its synthetic nature
4. **Learning to Walk** — Iterative progress over perfection
5. **Add Value, Not Remove** — Technology augments human work, never replaces it
6. **Plan-Then-Execute** — Validate coherent plans before executing non-trivial tasks
7. **Sovereign Integrity Check** — Pause if directives conflict with ground truth

These principles ensure human-AI collaboration remains symbiotic rather than extractive.

## How We Remember (SSoT Hierarchy)

ResonantOS uses a structured knowledge management system called SSoT (Single Source of Truth):

| Level | Scope | What Lives Here | Update Frequency |
|-------|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| **L0** | Foundation | Vision, philosophy, business plan, identity | Rarely |
| **L1** | Architecture | System specs, component designs, integration patterns | Monthly |
| **L2** | Projects | Active work items, current milestones, decisions | Weekly |
| **L3** | Drafts | Work-in-progress ideas, experimental concepts | As needed |
| **L4** | Notes | Raw captures, session logs, ephemeral content | Daily |

**Awareness Model:** Load L0 for the full picture with minimal tokens. Zoom into L1-L4 for precision. This prevents the AI from making decisions without proper context.

---

## Current State (February 2026)

### Technical Foundation
- **Platform:** Built on OpenClaw kernel 
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.6 with 1M context window
- **Interface:** Telegram integration with inline capabilities
- **Memory:** R-Memory v2 system (rebuilt for OpenClaw compatibility)

### Development Status
- **Target:** Public alpha release March 2026
- **Platforms:** macOS first, then Linux/Windows
- **Architecture:** All components designed to integrate WITH OpenClaw, never replacing existing functionality

### Key Learnings
Previous R-Memory v1 failed due to conflicts with OpenClaw's built-in systems. v2 approach prioritizes understanding and enhancing OpenClaw's internals rather than replacing them.

---

## Core Architecture Principle

**Integration Over Replacement**

ResonantOS is NOT a fork of OpenClaw. It is a compatible experience layer that enhances OpenClaw's existing systems:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         ResonantOS Layer            │
│  (SSoT, Memory, Security, etc.)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         OpenClaw Kernel             │  
│  (Gateway, Sessions, Tools, Cron)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Infrastructure              │
│  (macOS, Telegram, Anthropic API)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This architectural decision ensures stability, compatibility, and leverages OpenClaw's robust foundation.

## Vision: The Multiverse

ResonantOS contributes to building the "Multiverse" — a diverse ecosystem of sovereign AIs that serve their practitioners' unique visions:

### Individual Level
- Humans maintain cognitive sovereignty
- AI augments rather than replaces human capability
- Tools adapt to user needs, not corporate metrics

### Community Level  
- Diverse AI "worlds" rather than corporate monoculture
- Open protocols enable AI-to-AI collaboration
- Peer networks ensure accountability and integrity

### Societal Level
- Resistance to cognitive colonization
- Protection of cultural and intellectual diversity
- Demonstration that ethical AI collaboration is possible

## Getting Started (Alpha Testers)

### Installation
1. Ensure OpenClaw is installed and configured
2. Install ResonantOS package via installer
3. Configure initial settings through Dashboard
4. Load L0 documents to understand philosophy and approach

### First Steps
1. **Read the Philosophy** (`L0/PHILOSOPHY.md`) — Understand the "why"
2. **Review the Constitution** (`L0/CONSTITUTION.md`) — Learn collaboration principles  
3. **Explore System Architecture** (`L1/SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md`) — Technical overview
4. **Start with Simple Commands** — Use `/R list` to see loaded documents

### Best Practices
- Let R-Awareness handle document loading automatically via keywords
- Use manual `/R load` commands for drafts and specific research
- Check `/R list` periodically to understand current context
- Engage with the philosophy, not just the technology
